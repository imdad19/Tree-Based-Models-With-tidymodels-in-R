Predicting Loans Using Tree-Based Models
This project applies a range of tree-based machine learning models, including Decision Trees, Random Forest, Bagged Trees, and Boosted Trees, to predict loan approval outcomes. By leveraging hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques, this analysis optimizes model performance on a loans dataset to identify patterns and improve decision-making accuracy.

Project Overview
The main goals of this project are:
- To evaluate and compare different tree-based models for predictive accuracy.
- To optimize each model using grid search techniques, focusing on key parameters for decision-making.
- To provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each model type within the context of financial data.

Models Explored:
- Decision Trees: Provides simple interpretability but may lack robustness.
- Random Forest: Reduces overfitting through ensemble learning.
- Bagged Trees: Aggregates multiple weak learners to enhance stability.
- Boosted Trees: Improves accuracy through iterative learning.

Key Features
- Grid Search & Hyperparameter Tuning: Each model is fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance on the loans dataset.
- Cross-Validation: Ensures model robustness and generalizability.
- Documentation: All analysis steps are clearly documented in a Quarto website hosted on GitHub Pages, with detailed explanations of each model and tuning method.

Getting Started:
Clone this repository, install the necessary libraries, and run the Quarto document to replicate the analysis. Custom CSS styling and a footer are included for enhanced readability in HTML and PDF formats.
